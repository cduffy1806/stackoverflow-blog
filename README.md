### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2023 to better understand:

* Which programming languages, frameworks, and tools are the most popular?
* Can we use a developers education level and tech stack experience to predict their developer role?
* How significant are Salary differences across Developer Roles 

The full set of csv files related to this analysis [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/)

### File Description
There is one notebook available [here](https://github.com/cduffy1806/stackoverflow-blog/blob/main/stackoverflow_survey_analysis.ipynb) to showcase work related to the above questions. 

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
